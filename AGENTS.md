## Building and Testing

After making changes to the app, build and run it in the simulator:

```bash
./run.sh
```

To verify UI changes, take a screenshot of the simulator:

```bash
./screenshot.sh
```

Then read the screenshot to see how the app looks:

```bash
# Use the Read tool on /tmp/simulator-screenshot.png
```
